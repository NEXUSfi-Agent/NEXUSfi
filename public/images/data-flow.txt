Data Flow Diagram Instructions

The data flow diagram should be created as a PNG image (data-flow.png) with the following components:

1. Sequential data flow visualization showing:
   - User interaction (input)
   - Data retrieval from APIs/blockchain
   - Business logic processing
   - State management
   - UI rendering
   - Data persistence

2. Strategy Data Flow specifics:
   - Strategy selection process
   - Risk profile assessment
   - Portfolio construction
   - Asset allocation
   - Performance monitoring
   - Rebalancing triggers

3. Use directional arrows to show data movement between components

4. Include representation of:
   - User actions
   - System responses
   - Data transformations
   - Decision points
   - Output destinations

5. Use a consistent color scheme matching the architecture diagram:
   - Process nodes in blue gradient
   - Data stores in muted blue
   - External entities in accent blue
   - Flow lines in dark gray
   - Critical paths highlighted

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual data-flow.png image that should be created by a designer or using a diagramming tool.
