Implementation Flow Diagram Instructions

The implementation flow diagram should be created as a PNG image (implementation-flow.png) with the following components:

1. Strategy Management Implementation Flow:
   - User Profile Component -> Preferences Collection
   - Market Data Analysis Engine
   - Risk Assessment Models
   - Strategy Selection Algorithms
   - Portfolio Construction Service
   - Rebalancing Engine
   - Performance Tracking Dashboard

2. Connection points between components showing:
   - Data dependencies
   - Service integrations
   - Control flow
   - Feedback loops

3. Technical implementation details:
   - React Components hierarchy
   - API Service layer
   - State Management approach
   - Data Validation steps
   - Error Handling mechanisms
   - Blockchain Integration points

4. Use a consistent visual language:
   - Components as rounded rectangles
   - Services as hexagons
   - Data stores as cylinders
   - External systems as clouds
   - User interactions as diamonds

5. Color scheme matching project branding:
   - Primary flow in blue gradient
   - Secondary processes in teal
   - External systems in neutral gray
   - Critical paths highlighted in accent color

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual implementation-flow.png image that should be created by a designer or using a diagramming tool.
