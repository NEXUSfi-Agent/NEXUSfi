Architecture Diagram Instructions

The architecture diagram should be created as a PNG image (architecture.png) with the following components:

1. High-level system architecture:
   - Frontend Layer (Next.js, React, TypeScript)
   - API/Middleware Layer
   - Blockchain Layer (Solana Programs)
   - Data Storage Layer

2. Show clear interactions between components with arrows

3. Include icons/representations for:
   - User interactions
   - Wallet connections
   - Smart contracts
   - AI/ML models
   - Data flows

4. Use a professional color scheme with:
   - Blue gradient (#3498db to #1a3c6e) for main components
   - Accent color (#36D1DC) for highlighted elements
   - White text for readability
   - Light gray backgrounds for containers

5. Include a legend explaining the components

This file serves as a placeholder for the actual architecture.png image that should be created by a designer or using a diagramming tool.
